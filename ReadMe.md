[![Build Status](https://gustinn.visualstudio.com/Exp/_apis/build/status/GustinAG.patterns-active-record?branchName=master)](https://gustinn.visualstudio.com/Exp/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master)

# Goal of This
Demontsrating these architecture paterns within working code in a very simplified way.
This might help better understand them.

On the other hand, with the help of this sample code, you will ***not*** see the complictions that come with a huge, complex project.
Also, in a real life, complex project, you would like to utilize an ootb Active Record tool *(like e.g. [Castle Active Record](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/activerecord/))* - instead of implementing it by yourself.

# What You Need For This
 + Visual Studio 2019 - *or higher* - incl.:
    + C# stuff
    + .NET Framework 4.7
    + Markdown Editor
    + StyleCop
 + Also recommended:
    + ReSharper
    + TortoiseGit
    + Notepad++ including XML Tools
